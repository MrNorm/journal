# Introduction
Here I go again! Another 'blog' or some mechanism of throwing life updates out there. This is probably the third reboot of something like this for me but this one feels far more important for me to keep maintained. My life has become more complicated and I have lost track of what is important to me or what makes me feel happy. Combine that with pandemic confusion and undertaking a huge home renovation project, it's a perfect storm for me. 

I usually start these projects in the wrong order, focusing on the code first and the content second. I always try to get the structure planned before I publish anything. With this project I will be focusing on content first and structure second. This yarn is just an markdown document in a folder, so you can't get any more simple than that!

This project exists so I can keep track of my life, the things around it and the things I enjoy. I want to document my progress so I can continually reflect on where I've come and what I'd like to focus on. I beleive this recipe will work, so if you're not me and you're reading this, welcome and I hope you can find my learnings in future content useful.
